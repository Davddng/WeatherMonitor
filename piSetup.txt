Things I did to get bluetooth working on raspberry pi

sudo apt-get install pi-bluetooth 

sudo modprobe btusb  # add the btusb module to the kernel
sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service

systemctl start hciuart


Other setup 
Enable I2C, SPI, Serial, and 1-Wire interfaces using raspi-config
(may need to remove external management with sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED)
pip3 install bleak 
pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask_cors
pip3 install adafruit-blinka
pip3 install schedule
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-bmp280
pip install Adafruit-DHT

Modifying /boot/config.txt for camera support
add "start_x=1" to enable camera support in the firmware (not libcamera)
libcamera support requires camera_auto_detect=1 in config.txt (on current/Bullseye firmware), and dtoverlay=imx219, dtoverlay=imx477 etc.

Python process doesn't seem to quit using Ctrl-C, so it must be killed manually using by getting the parent pid using:
ps -eLf | grep -i '[p]ython'

Then:
kill -1 [pid]

Optional: Use a terminal multiplexer to start main.py using ssh, then detach session and log out while main.py keeps running.
Used GNU Screen, but tmux is also good.

sudo apt-get install screen

To create a screen:
screen -S [screen name]

To view all open screens:
screen –ls

To detach current session:
Ctrl+A  –d

To reattach session:
screen –r [screen_ID/screen_name]
